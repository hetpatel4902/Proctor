# 🛡️ Proctify — Real-Time Proctoring Solution

Proctify is a real-time proctored examination platform designed to maintain the integrity and security of online examinations.

The solution combines an **admin website, student website, custom ElectronJS examination browser, real-time monitoring, and machine-learning-based cheating detection** to create a controlled examination environment.

Developed as a team project for the **Smart India Hackathon** problem statement:

> **Develop a Proctored Exam Tool for shortlisting the candidates for national and international level hackathons.**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Online examinations make it difficult to maintain examination integrity when students can switch applications, use keyboard shortcuts, access unauthorized resources, or attempt to impersonate another candidate.

A conventional browser-based examination system has limited control over operating-system-level interactions.

Proctify addresses these challenges through a combination of:

- A dedicated student examination platform
- A custom-built desktop examination browser
- Real-time webcam and screen monitoring
- Face verification
- Computer-vision-based suspicious activity detection
- Audio monitoring
- Administrative examination management

---

# 💡 Solution Overview

The Proctify ecosystem consists of multiple components working together to provide a secure examination experience.

The custom browser addresses a limitation of conventional web-based examinations: websites cannot provide the same level of control over operating-system-level interactions.

---

# 🔐 Secure Examination Environment

The custom browser forms the controlled student-side environment of the platform.

# 🤖 5. Machine Learning & Computer Vision

The solution incorporates machine-learning-based monitoring to reduce the manual effort required to supervise candidates.

The system includes capabilities for detecting:

- Face recognition
- Eye tracking
- Mobile phone usage
- Suspicious behavior
- Low-light conditions
- Multiple persons in the frame
- Unauthorized materials
- Books

The system also processes student audio for human-voice detection.

             Suspicious Activity
                 Detection
```

---

# 🔎 6. Cheating Detection

The machine-learning component is designed to identify behaviors that may indicate examination violations.

Examples include:

- Looking away from the examination environment
- Mobile phone usage
- Multiple people appearing in the camera frame
- Suspicious objects or materials
- Books or unauthorized resources
- Voice activity
- Low-light conditions

These signals can assist the proctor during examination monitoring and reduce the need for entirely manual supervision.

---

# 👤 7. Face Verification

Face verification is incorporated into important stages of the student workflow.

It is used during:

1. Student registration
2. Examination registration/access
3. Examination start

This helps reduce the possibility of impersonation.

# 💭 Why a Custom Browser?

A conventional web application cannot fully control operating-system-level interactions such as:

```text
Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V
Alt+Tab
Windows Shortcuts
External Applications
Hardware Interfaces
Screen-Sharing Utilities
```

The custom Electron browser was therefore developed to provide a more controlled examination environment.

# 📉 Reducing Manual Proctoring Effort

Monitoring every candidate's webcam and screen manually becomes increasingly difficult as the number of candidates increases.

Proctify combines live monitoring with automated analysis to assist the proctor.
